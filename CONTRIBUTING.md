## Styleguides

### Code
We're using the google styleguide for ES-Lint. Please keep writing in this style
all the time. Ask before changing anything in the ES-Lint file. Try use self
explainable variable names, if you have to create a comment for the variable I
recommend you to change the variable name instead. Try to use ES6 syntax or
newer. Development :computer: is separated in 3 steps: 1. Make it work, 2.Make it clean,
3.Make it fast
