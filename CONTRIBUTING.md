# Thank you for contributing to alerts-js.
Here you can read some general information about how to contribute to the project.

## Styleguides

### Code
We're using the google styleguide for ES-Lint. Please keep writing in this style
all the time. Ask before changing anything in the ES-Lint file. Try use self
explainable variable names, if you have to create a comment for the variable I
recommend you to change the variable name instead. Try to use ES6 syntax or
newer. Development :computer: is separated in 3 steps: 1. Make it work, 2.Make it clean,
3.Make it fast

### Design
<p align="center">

</p>
If you want to contribute by creating a design for AlertJS, you've to view the basic structure of our alerts first.
Like in the image above the alert consists of a background which contains the main information of the alert.
On the top of the alert is an optional icon to create a clear expression of the card.
Beneath is a big title with the core message of the alert and followed by a description or note.
On the bottom there's usually one or two buttons which contain the actions you want the user to take.
Feel free to play around with colors, fonts etc. and create awesome designs.
Please send us your design as an image file or as .psd .xd and so on.
We're looking forward to see awesome designs from you :smile:!
